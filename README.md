# Algorithm Challenge – Level 3 | #9 Print Middle Row and Middle Column of a Matrix

🧮 Problem Description
-
This challenge demonstrates how to extract the middle row and the middle column from a 3×3 matrix filled with random numbers.

The program prints the full matrix first, then highlights its central horizontal and vertical elements.

---

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- Navigating two-dimensional arrays
- Identifying middle indices in odd-sized matrices
- Extracting row-based and column-based data
- Understanding fixed vs changing indices
- Writing clean and modular C++ functions

---

🧩 Core Algorithm Concept
-
The middle index is calculated using integer division:

- Middle Row = Rows / 2
- 
- Middle Column = Columns / 2


This allows precise access to the center of the matrix.
